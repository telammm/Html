<p align="center">I think that I shall never see<br>
A poem lovely as a tree.<br>
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;<br>
A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br>
A tree that may in summer wear<br>
A nest of robins in her hair;<br>
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
Who intimately lives with rain.<br>
Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
But only God can make a tree.<br>
